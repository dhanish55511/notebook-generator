          "### **Build Model**\n\nBuild your model using the training data set. Use the `DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL2` procedure to build your model and specify the model settings.\n\nFor a supervised learning, like Classification, before creating the model, split the data into training and test data. Although you can use the entire data set to build a model, it is difficult to validate the model unless there are new data sets available. Therefore, to evaluate the model and to accurately assess the performance of the model on the same data, you generally split or separate the data into training and test data. You use the training data set to train the model and then use the test data set to test the accuracy of the model by running prediction queries. The testing data set already contains known values for the attribute that you want to predict. It is thus easy to determine whether the predictions of the model are correct.\n\n\n**Algorithm Selection**\n\nBefore you build a model, choose the suitable algorithm. You can choose one of the following algorithms to solve a classification problem:\n\n* Decision Tree\n* Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESM)\n* Generalized Linear Model (GLM)\n* Naive Bayes\n* Random Forest\n* Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n* XGBoost\n\nFrom the above algorithms, ESM is more about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining. ESM does not apply to this use case and data. If you were to select a relatively simple linear model like GLM, the prediction accuracy can be further improved by the Random Forest algorithm. Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees on subsets of the data re-sampled at each time (bagging). This avoids the overfitting for a single decision tree. The random forest model is a widely used ensemble method that is known to have higher accuracy than linear models. Thus, Random Forest is selected for this use case.\n\nFor this use case, split the data into 60/40 as training and test data. You build the model using the training data and once the model is built, score the test data using the model.\n\nThe following steps guide you to split your data and build your model with the selected algorithm.\n"

If the model performs well and meets your business requirements, it can then be applied to new data to predict the future. These matrices can help you to compare models to arrive at one model that satisfies your evaluation criteria.  \n\nLift measures the degree to which the predictions of a classification model are better than randomly-generated predictions. Lift can be understood as a ratio of two percentages: the percentage of correct positive classifications made by the model to the percentage of actual positive classifications in the test data.\n\nA confusion matrix displays the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model compared with the actual classifications in the test data. The matrix is n-by-n, where n is the number of classes.\n"
