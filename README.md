This layout:  
- Follows the **standard GitHub README structure**.  
- Groups installation, usage, and contribution logically.  
- Uses **clear step-by-step formatting** so beginners won‚Äôt get lost.  

If you want, I can also **add a "Quick Start" section at the very top** so advanced users can install & run in just two commands without reading the full instructions. That way, both beginners and pros are happy.
